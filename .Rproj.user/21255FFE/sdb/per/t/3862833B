    "contents" : "#' Artificial dataset of performance outcomes and demographic variables.\n#'\n#' This dataset has been created to try out the \\code{perfman} package\n#' functions on.  It illustrates the format that the package currently requires\n#' the data to be in to work straightforwardly.\n#' \n#' Each row represents one person.  This person's outcome from the performance\n#' management process is recorded: this is a whole number between 1 and 4 where\n#' 1 represents the worst score and 4 the best.  Each person has observations\n#' recorded of their gender, ethnicity, disability and age.  Ethnicity and\n#' disability are self-reported and suffer from non-response, but the\n#' non-response categories are coded for as separate categories (and not coded\n#' using \\code{NA} or similar).\n#' \n#' It is important to note that the first column has to be called \\code{outcome}\n#' and has to be an ordered factor using integers starting from 1 in sequence.  \n#' Note, too, that the other columns represent variables that will be fitted in\n#' the ordered logistic model, and they need to be caegorical (and therefore \n#' represented using factors).\n#'\n#' @format A data frame with 200 rows and 5 variables.  Each row represents a \n#' person.  The first column is an ordered factor containing all the integers \n#' from 1 to 4.\n#' \\describe{\n#'   \\item{outcome}{Result from the performance management process for this \n#'   person, where 1 is the worst category and 4 the best.
