Description: This package implements the method used by the author to report
    probability distributions following the use of ordered logistic regressions.
    Currently designed to work when all explanatory variables are categorical
    and there are no interactions.  The dataset needs to have the first column
    named 'outcome' and be an ordered factor, as in the 'test.data' example.
